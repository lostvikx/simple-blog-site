# A Simple Blog Site

This is my first node.js project. Learned a lot of new things such as connecting your app to MongoDB, using schema to model the database.

Used express.js for the first time as well. Learned about routes, routers.

The project uses ejs as its view engine to render the site, it makes life a bit easier by using partials.

Used the MVC standard in web-development. Controllers just makes managing and reading files simpler.

I enjoyed building this project.

To use this project just create a MongoDB cloud account, then create a new collection and name it whatever you like, then update the `config-test.js` and `mongo-uri-test.js` in the [test](./test) directory.
